# GoatOS
GoatOS -- an operating system made for goats.

This project is currently not made to be actually used but just for me to experiment and attempt
to create an operating system.

If you do decide to use this operating system I cannot and will not guarantee anything. Use it at
your own risk. See the license for any details on how this operating system can be used, distributed, etc.
